MCLP 모델을 이용한 은평구, 마포구, 서대문구 노인 복지 시설 재배치 지도 제작 / Finding Map of the Redistributed Welfare Facilities for the Elderly in Eunpyeong-gu, Mapo-gu, and Seodaemun-gu using MCLP Model / 김서진 · 김승준 · 이준영A · 조자룡 / As Korea enters an aging society, discussions are taking place on the accessibility of medical welfare facilities needed by the elderly. However, most of the studies did not deal with the specificity of one region. Therefore, this study aims to stabilize the accessibility by relocating medical welfare facilities in the region, especially targeting Eunpyeong-gu, Mapogu, Seodaemun-gu. To this end, the difference in facility accessibility between densely populated areas and sparse areas was minimized by investigating the number of people eligible for those facilities in each region and calculating the population and accessibility figures for public transportation by the region using MCLP model. As a result, a map of redistributed facilities was drawn through a model that optimized the difference in access to medical welfare facilities by region. This study proposed a method of mitigating the difference in accessibility of facilities between regions through the applied MCLP model, which suggests that it can be used in future studies targeting other regions. / MCLP, Accessibility, Medical welfare facility, Rearrangement / AC3486

퇴적현상으로 인한 밤섬의 육지화가 한강 홍수에 미치는 영향에 대한 수리적 고찰 / Hydraulic Analysis of Bamseom Terrestrialization and Its Impact on Flood Dynamics on Hangang River / 양성연 · 이윤하 / Based on Bamseom’s geological and ecological significance, this study analyzes the influence of Bamseom’s recent change in its area and terrestrialization on the flow of Hangang River and ultimately occurrence of flood. Terrestrialization and area increase require great attention, because they result from sedimentation processes, which would only worsen in our nearest future. This study integrates several numerical data sets such as the annual increase of Bamseom area, the water level of adjacent Hangang River, and digital elevation model (DEM) to create a river simulation model for Bamseom and the surrounding area. We operated HECRAS (U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s River Analysis System) in order to visualize Hangang River, and thus simulating the river flow in the circumstance of flood. Our founding gained from multiple simulation suggests that the terrestrialization phenomenon itself is not an urgent issue that can instantly change the flow of Hangang river. However, when the intensity of terrestrialization increases, it can severely affect the flow of the river and thus promotes flood occurrence. Therefore, our study holds its significance by emphasizing the impact that Bamseom’s change has on the flow of the river and furthermore urges to pay more attention to Bamseom, not just as the ecological hub in city, but for the sake of neighbor’s safety. / Bamseom, terrestrialization, HEC-RAS, river flow simulation of flood / AC0016
